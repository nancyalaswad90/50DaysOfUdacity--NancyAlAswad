Repo to keep track of my progress during the #50DaysOfUdacity



## What is the #50DaysofUdacity Challenge?


The premise of this challenge is to build a habit of consistent practice of new skills by making a public commitment of practicing the topics of your Foundation Course every day for 50 days.

Why? Because habits that emphasise consistent practice have been proven to help overall retention of new learning material.

This repo/template was created to make it easy to keep track of your progress during the challenge, and to add a visiual effect to your progess and commitment by updating your GitHub contribution chart daily (extra motivation!).
