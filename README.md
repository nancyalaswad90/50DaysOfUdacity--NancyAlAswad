# 50DaysOfUdacity




Repo to keep track of my progress during the **#50DaysOfUdacity**





## What is the #50DaysofUdacity Challenge?


**This challenge** is to build a habit of consistent practice of new skills by making a public commitment to practicing the topics of your Foundation Course every day for 50 days.

**The advantage here**

Because it builds habits that emphasize consistent practice to help the overall retention of new learning material.


**This repo**  is created to make it easy to keep track of my progress during the challenge and to add a visual effect to my progress and commitment by updating my GitHub contribution chart daily **(extra motivation!).**
